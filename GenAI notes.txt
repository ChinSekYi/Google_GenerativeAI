PaLM:
PaLM (Pathway Language Model) is a term used to refer to a family of language models that are pretrained on large amounts of text data to learn representations of language.
PaLM models are based on the Transformer architecture and are trained using a two-step process: pretraining and fine-tuning. During pretraining, the model learns to predict missing words in sentences or other related language tasks using a massive corpus of text data, such as books, articles, and web pages. This unsupervised pretraining step helps the model learn general linguistic patterns and acquire knowledge about language.
After pretraining, the PaLM model can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, and more. The fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt its pretrained knowledge to perform well on specific tasks with relatively limited labeled data.

GenAI vs Traditional AI:
Traditional – relies on analyzing and processing existing data to make predictions and recommendations. Trained on existing dataset.
GenAI – Creates new data that does not already exist in the training dataset.
Techniques in GenAI:
-	GANs – consist of a generator & a discriminator 
-	VAEs – learns a compressed representation of the input data, which is then used to generate new data. 

Using our own dataset. Connect with:
1. data loaders – can use advanced ETL pipelines (like unstructured.io)
2. vector databases – vectorise an array of unstructured data using LLM embeddings. These vectors are then stored for efficient querying
3. context window 
-	to personalize model outputs 
-	use the technique called retrieval-augmented generation. 
-	Allows developers to incorporate data directly into the prompt
-	LangChain & Llamalndex (allows integratin of data into the model’s context window)

Evaluation platform
1. Prompt engineering
2. Experimentation 
3. Observability – LangKit -> to check quality of model outputs
